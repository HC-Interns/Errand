## Status:
Build : In-Progress
> Code can manage one board only. So in the refactor to rust you can just spin-up new boards by spinning up new instances of the same zome

## TODO:

- [ ] Create Button To add new lane
> NOTE: Back-end code written | UI work started on branch "plug-in-frontend"

 - [ ] Manage multiple boards
